JPTemplate
==========

A simple yet powerful interactive template system for VIM


INSTALLATION
------------

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing [pathogen.vim][1], and then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/Jannis/jptemplate.git

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with `:help jptemplate`.
