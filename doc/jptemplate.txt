==============================================================================
1. Introduction				*jptemplate-introduction*

1.1. Features				*jptemplate-features*

Version 1.0
	- User variables (replaced with user input)
	- Special ${cursor} variable for defining the cursor position
	- Indentation
	- Separate templates for different filetypes
Version 1.1
	- Configurable keyboard shortcut
	- Default values for variables
Version 1.2
	- Support for special variables (with and without default value)
	- Support for global defaults for user variables
	- New special variable: ${date}
Verson 1.3
	- Bugfixes only
Verson 1.4
	- New special variables: ${shell:<put shell command here>} and
	  ${interactive_shell:...}
	- Remember last entered value for all non-special variables
	- Allow $ to appear in variable names and values
	- Bugfix: Automatically escape &, ~ and \ in variable values to avoid
	  unexpected behaviour
	- Bugfix: Just remove template trigger word if the resulting template
	  is empty
Verson 1.5 (NEW)
	- New feature: Use the general/ template directory as a fallback
	  lookup directory for all file types. This makes it possible to
	  use the same templates for different file types (and override
	  some of them if you like)
	- Bugfix: Really fix the cursor placement this time

==============================================================================
2. Prerequisies				*jptemplate-prerequisies*

All you need to have is VIM (no idea as of which version the plugin works)
with filetype detection enabled. To enable this, put the following into your
.vimrc:
>
	filetype plugin on
<
==============================================================================
3. Installation				*jptemplate-installation*

3.1. Installing the plugin

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing
pathogen.vim:

    https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen

And then simply copy and paste:
>
    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/Jannis/jptemplate.git
<
Once help tags have been generated, you can view this manual with:
>
    :help jptemplate
<
3.2. Configuring VIM			*jptemplate-configuring-vim*

All you need to do to configure VIM is to define the directory where all
templates can be found. By default $HOME/.vim/jptemplate/ is used.

If you want to define a directory on your own, put the following into your
.vimrc:
>
	let g:jpTemplateDir = '/path/to/the/template/directory'
<
3.2.1. Configuration parameters

							*g:jpTemplateDir*
g:jpTemplateDir
		'$HOME/.vim/jptemplate'
		Path to the template directory.

							*g:jpTemplateKey*
g:jpTemplateKey
		'<C-Tab>'
		Keyboard shortcut for triggering templates

							*g:jpTemplateDateFormat*
g:jpTemplateDateFormat
		'%Y-%m-%d'
		Default strftime format used for ${date}

							*g:jpTemplateDefaults*
g:jpTemplateDefaults
		{}
		Dictionary with global default values for (non-special)
		template variables.

							*g:jpTemplateVerbose*
g:jpTemplateVerbose
		0
		Can be used to increase the verbosity level (either 0 or 1).

==============================================================================
4. Usage				*jptemplate-usage*

4.1. Writing templates

Writing templates is easy. They are plain text files with embedded variables.
When triggering a template, you are asked to enter values for most of these
variables. After that the template is inserted into your document and all
variables are replaced by the values you defined before.

Variables are defined using the following syntax:
>
	${put variable name here}.
<
You can optionally provide a default value with
${variable name:default value}. You can also define global defaults for any of
these variables. See section Configuration parameters for more information.
Please note that the value in ${variable name:default value} will always
override the global default.

This is an example for a simple for loop:
>
	for (${initializer expression:int i = 0}; ${loop test expression}; ${counting expression:++i})
	    {
	      ${cursor}
        }
<
Please note that the ${cursor} variable is special. See the section Special
variables for more information about ${cursor} and other special variables.

You can also define one variable to appear several times in the same template.
In this case you'll be asked only once to enter a value for the variable.
Imagine a signature template:
>
	  Yours faithfully,
	  ${name}
	  
	  Address:
	    ${name}
	    ${street}
	    ${city}
<
Variables are case sensitive. Multiple occurences like ${x:i} ${x}' will yield
i i. ${x} ${x:i} with a global default j for x will result in i i. Templates
like ${x:i} ${x:j} ... end up as i i.

4.1.1. Directory structure

This section deals with the structure of the template directory. See section
|jptemplate-configuring-vim| on how to define it.

Let's assume for now that you are using the default template directory, which
is $HOME/.vim/jptemplate/. This is how the directory structure has to look
like:
>
	  $HOME/.vim/jptemplate/
	    cpp/
	      class
	      for
	      fun
	      if
	      ...
	    c -> cpp/
	    general/
	    ruby/
	      class
	      def
	      for
	      if
	      module
	      ...
	    sh/
	      ...
	    ...
<
Each subdirectory contains templates for one VIM file type. I guess the
template filenames are pretty self-explanatory: Each filename represents the
name you have to enter to trigger the template in VIM. Of course you can
create symlinks everywhere if you like (as I did with c -> cpp/ in the
example). Note that the general/ directory is special: it is used as a
fallback lookup directory for all filetypes (even unknown ones). This way you
can share templates across different file types.

Hint: If you need to find out the filetype of a file you want to write a plugin
for, just enter :echo &ft and VIM will tell you.

4.1.2. Special variables		*jptemplate-special-variables*

${cursor}
		Parameters: none
		This is where the cursor will be located after the
		template has been inserted into your document.

${date}
		Parameters: strftime format string (optional)
		Examples:	${date}
				${date:%Y-%m-%d}
		Insert the current date.

${shell}
		Parameters: Shell command
		Examples:	${shell:ls -la}
				${shell:firefox &>/dev/null}
		Run a shell command and replace the variable with its output.

${interactive_shell}
		Parameters: Shell command (optional)
		Examples:	See ${shell}
		Same as ${shell} but will ask you to enter a shell command
		prior to executing it.

4.2. Using templates

Using the templates is pretty straight-forwarded. Let's assume you're editing
a C++ file and you have a working for template. This is all you need to do to
trigger the template:
>
	for<C-Tab>
<
Pressing <C-Tab> will lookup the template for. If the template contains any
non-reserved variables, VIM will start asking you to enter values for these
variables. Once all questions have been answered, the template will inserted
where the for was in your code. If the template contains ${cursor}, the cursor
will be moved to that position.

4.2.1. Changing the keyboard shortcut

You can change the keyboard shortcut by setting the variable g:jpTemplateKey in
your .vimrc. Example:
>
	let g:jpTemplateKey = '<Esc>'
<
4.3. Demonstration videos

These are some demo videos I prepared of version 1.0 of the script. See the
|jptemplate-features| section for a list of features supported by more recent
versions.
